# ASP.NET WebApp using SQL Server CE while geared for free web hosting + DB hosting at the same time

This is a demonstration ASP.NET Web App which uses an SQL Server CE to store data.

With a free tier IaaS instance box you are able to host a webapp along with the data.

Fully managed scenarios and scaling horizontally does not work with this, since the data is stored locally.

This code is a companion to a talk I gave on this topic for Central California .NET User group.
